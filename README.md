Graceful degradation is where we ensure that an application can gracefully function enough even with lower level technologies; it helps build a web app even when advanced technologies are unavailable. Service workers is a way to achieve graceful degradation - it enables offline functionality and also caching, so that even when there is poor or even no internet connection, the basic parts of the app still works, and isn't completely broken. It guarantees certain reliability for the app.
